		`What is a Battlepass?`,
		`If you are not familiar with battle passes, they are a kind of revenue approach common in free-to-play video games.
		They reward users for playing a certain game and completing quests—like in Fortnite.
		Gamers can get rewarded with in-game goodies like skins, dances, or sprays.
		Usually, battle passes are tiered, with free and premium versions.
		We apply this model to esports organizations and content creators in a customisable way.
		This allows creators to incentivise fan engagement, reward their community, and monetise these interactions.
		Rewards vary from digital collectibles to store discounts and more, as decided by the creator.
		This results in an alternative revenue stream, and an expanded, more sustainable business model overall.`,

		`How Can I Buy the Battlepass?`,
		`You can purchase a premium Battlepass with a credit or debit card — as easy as 1, 2, 3.
		On the battlepass you would like to subscribe or buy, just click on the GO PREMIUM button on the respective Battlepass.`,

		`What is GameDAO?`,
		`GameDAO is a multifaceted co-ordination hub where gamers, creators, investors and esports orgs can come together to form clans (DAOs).
		They can use these to work together to achieve common goals using democratic technology — through voting, proposals, etc.
		GameDAO has a number of decentralized applications, including Battlepasses.
		GameDAO will also provide co-ordination functionality to groups of investors that want to invest in games through our Investor Syndicate application.

		`How can I register my organization?`,
		`For our early testing, we have partnered with esports teams ÆX-1 and WAVE to bring the Battlepass to their fans.
		Later, we will onboard more esports and creator teams to bring our fan engagement platform to their communities.
		Currently, Battlepass creation is done manually on our end — if you would like to be one of the first to join the likes of AEX-1 and WAVE,
		drop us a line in our Discord.
		In the future, organizations will be allowed to self onboard our platform, create and customize their own Battlepasses more freely.`,

		`Do I need a digital wallet?`,
		`You will not need a Web3 Wallet to buy the Battlepass or receive all of the rewards from the Battlepasses.
		However, some rewards — including digital collectibles — will require a Web3 wallet to redeem them.`,

		`How do I get a digital wallet?`,
		`To create a free self custodial digital wallet, head over to https://www.talisman.xyz/.
		We have created a How-To guide which you can read on https://docs.gamedao.co. Check out Section 1 for how to create a wallet and get started.`,

		`What else can I do on GameDAO?`,
		`On GameDAO, you will soon be able to crowdfund upcoming games and gaming projects, vote on proposals and changes, and much more.
		We would like to bring this democratic technology to esports organizations, too, allowing fans to have a real say in everything from branding,
		to player swaps, merch drops and more — all by voting and passing proposals, enabled by GameDAO.`,

	[
		`How does the tech work behind the Battlepass?`,
		`To power true digital ownership and trade of the digital collectibles featured as rewards in the Battlepass,
		we use blockchain technology and Non-Fungible Tokens. This technology means you can really own your collectibles in a digital wallet,
		as well as trade and sell them in the future if you no longer want them.
		We are using GameDAO's own ZERO Network, powered by Polkadot. Polkadot is a 'nominated proof-of-stake' blockchain — you do not have to understand what this is,
		but it is more than 99% more energy efficient than other networks like Bitcoin. This makes it much better for the environment than other blockchain technologies.`,
