GameDAO is a community owned fundraising, coordination and ownership protocol for the GAME industry ( Games, Arts, Music, Entertainment ). It is governed by the GAME token and follows the vision to create a legal DAO and fully regulatory compliant protocols, thus enabling transition of traditional gamers, creators, publishers, investors to make use of decentralised protocols.

- CONTROL — building unstoppable organizations
- FLOW — fundraising and project curation
- SIGNAL — coordination to organize and prioritize and coordinate use of funds
- TANGRAM — collectable based rewards, gamification and governance protocols.
