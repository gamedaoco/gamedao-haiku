GameDAO is a community owned and governed DAO providing community centric protocols:

- building unstoppable organizations
- community shared ownership
- fundraising and project curation
- coordination to organize and prioritize and coordinate use of funds
- collectable based rewards, gamification and governance protocols.

These enable crowdfunding and governance protocols and aim at videogame creators and players, creators and eSports communities.

GameDAO as a dApp is running on [ZERO.IO]<https://zero.io], a substrate based multichain network featuring decentralised protocols for the videogames industry.
